# Numadic API Project

## Introduction
Greetings Team Numadic,

Welcome to the Numadic API project! This repository contains the implementation of the API with the functionalities specified in the PRS. I encourage you to go through the Video Demo in the repository for a detailed overview.

## Test Cases
During the demo, we used the following test cases to showcase the API's capabilities:

### Test Case 1 (Not working payload)

Payload:
```json
{
  "start_time": 1519161600,
  "end_time": 1519401599
}
```

### Test Case 2 (Working payload)

Payload:
```json
{
  "start_time": 1519862400,
  "end_time": 1519894800
}
```

Data Requirement
Please note that for the code to work as intended, the file NU-raw-location-dump.zip and Trip-Info needs to be present in the same folder as the code. Make sure to have these files available before running the API.

Scope of Improvement
The current version of the code covers most of the cases, but there is still a huge scope for improvement. Some areas that could be enhanced include data preprocessing, handling wrong payload cases, and more. However, due to time constraints and other commitments, this version represents the best working implementation I could deliver.

Conclusion
Thank you for exploring the Numadic API project. I hope you find it useful and valuable. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out.

Best Regards,
Manvendra
